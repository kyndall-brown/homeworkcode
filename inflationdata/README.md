# FRED Inflation Data:
this readme has all the variable definitions for the three csv files
updated! now with Year over Year changes for all of the state and MSA variables!
The suffix _YOY after the variable indicates the percent change year over year, 
so we don't have to calculate it :)

FRED Graph Observations				* MSA = "metropolitan statistical area"		

Federal Reserve Economic Data				* some states share their largest MSA with a neighboring  state								
Link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org				* New Jersey's MSA is part of New York's MSA, so I put a placeholder data (NJPCPI) to keep everything 
here in the same order as the other file								

Help: https://fredhelp.stlouisfed.org				* in alphabetical order by state not city								
Economic Research Division				* data is 1969 to 2020
